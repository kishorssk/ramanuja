			 <p>The details of historic Ramanuja are unknown. His followers in the Sri Vaishnava tradition wrote hagiographies, some of which were composed in centuries after his death, and which the tradition believes to be true.</p>

<p>The traditional hagiographies of Ramanuja state he was born in a Brahmin family, to mother Kantimath and father Kesava Somayaji, in a village near modern Chennai.They place his life in the period of 1017â€“1137 CE, yielding a lifespan of 120 years. These dates have been questioned by modern scholarship, based on temple records and regional literature of 11th- and 12th-century outside the Sri Vaishnava tradition, and modern era scholars suggest that Ramanuja may have lived between 1077-1157.</p>

<p>Ramanuja married, moved to Kanchipuram, studied in a Advaita Vedanta monastery with Yadava Prakasa as his guru. Ramanuja and his guru frequently disagreed in interpreting Vedic texts, particularly the Upanishads. Ramanuja and Yadava Prakasa separated, and thereafter Ramanuja continued his studies on his own.</p>

<p>He attempted to meet another famed Vedanta scholar of 11th-century Yamunacharya, but Sri Vaishnava tradition holds that the latter died before the meeting and they never met. However, some hagiographies assert that the corpse of Yamunacharya miraculously rose and named Ramanuja as the new leader of Sri Vaishnava sect previously led by Yamunacharya. One hagiography states that after leaving Yadava Prakasa, Ramanuja was initiated into Sri Vaishnavism by Periya Nambi, also called Mahapurna, another Vedanta scholar. Ramanuja renounced his married life, and became a Hindu monk. However, states Katherine Young, the historical evidence on whether Ramanuja led a married life or did renounce and become a monk is uncertain.</p>

<p>Ramanuja became the priest at the Varadaraja (Vishnu) Srirangam temple at Kanchipuram, where he began to teach that moksha (liberation and release from samsara) is to be achieved not with metaphysical, nirguna Brahman but with the help of personal god and saguna Vishnu. Ramanuja has long enjoyed foremost authority in the Sri Vaishnava tradition. He reformed the Srirangam temple complex, undertook India-wide tours and expanded the reach of his organization.</p>
